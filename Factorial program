The factorial of a number is the product of all the integers from 1 to that number.

For example, the factorial of 6 is 1*2*3*4*5*6 = 720. Factorial is not defined for negative numbers, and the factorial of zero is one, 0! = 1.

Factorial of a Number using Loop
# Python program to find the factorial of a number provided by the user.

# change the value for a different result
num = 7

# To take input from the user
#num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

factorial = 1

# check if the number is negative, positive or zero
if num < 0:
   print("Sorry, factorial does not exist for negative numbers")
elif num == 0:
   print("The factorial of 0 is 1")
else:
   for i in range(1,num + 1):
       factorial = factorial*i
   print("The factorial of",num,"is",factorial)
